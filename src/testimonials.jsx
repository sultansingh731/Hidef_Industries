    {
      question: "What is ramming mass and how does it benefit steel production?",
      answer: "Ramming mass is a refractory material used to line induction furnaces in steel production. Our premium ramming mass provides superior thermal insulation, extends furnace life, reduces energy consumption, and ensures consistent steel quality. It forms a protective barrier between the molten metal and furnace structure, preventing heat loss and contamination."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes HiDef's SILRAM 98.5 superior to other products?",
      answer: "SILRAM 98.5 contains 98.5% silicon carbide content, offering exceptional thermal conductivity, chemical resistance, and thermal shock resistance. It provides 30-40% longer campaign life compared to standard products, reduced maintenance costs, faster heat-up times, and superior corrosion resistance against molten metals and slags."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you provide custom blends for specific furnace requirements?",
      answer: "Yes, we specialize in custom formulations based on your furnace type, operating temperature, tonnage capacity, and specific metallurgical requirements. Our technical team analyzes your needs and develops tailored solutions including particle size distribution, chemical composition, and thermal properties optimized for your operations."
    },
    {
      question: "What technical support do you provide after product delivery?",
      answer: "We offer comprehensive technical support including installation guidance, application techniques, troubleshooting assistance, performance monitoring, regular quality assessments, and furnace optimization recommendations. Our technical experts are available for on-site consultations and training sessions."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the typical delivery timeframes for your products?",
      answer: "Standard products like SILRAM 98.5 and LRM are typically delivered within 7-10 days across India. Custom blends require 15-20 days for formulation and testing. We maintain strategic inventory locations to ensure faster delivery to major steel production hubs. Urgent requirements can be expedited based on availability."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you ensure consistent product quality across batches?",
      answer: "We maintain rigorous quality control with ISO-certified processes, automated batch monitoring systems, comprehensive raw material testing, in-process quality checks, final product certification, and third-party laboratory validation. Each batch comes with detailed quality certificates and technical data sheets."
    },
    {
      question: "What packaging and storage recommendations do you provide?",
      answer: "Our products are supplied in moisture-resistant packaging (25kg/50kg bags or bulk containers). Store in dry, covered areas away from direct moisture, maintain temperature below 40Â°C, use within 12 months of manufacture for optimal performance, and follow FIFO (First In, First Out) inventory management."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you supply internationally or only within India?",
      answer: "Currently, we primarily serve the Indian market with strong presence across major steel production states. We are expanding to international markets and can accommodate export orders with appropriate lead times. Please contact us for specific international requirements and shipping arrangements."
    },
    {
      question: "What certifications and compliance standards do your products meet?",
      answer: "Our products comply with IS standards, BIS certifications, ISO 9001:2015 quality management, environmental compliance certifications, and customer-specific quality standards. We provide detailed technical data sheets, chemical analysis reports, and thermal property certifications with every shipment."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I determine the right product for my furnace application?",
      answer: "Our technical team evaluates factors including furnace type (induction/arc), operating temperature range, furnace capacity, metal grades processed, current lining performance, and maintenance schedules. Contact us with your furnace specifications for personalized product recommendations and application guidance."
